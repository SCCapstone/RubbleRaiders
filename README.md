# RubbleRaiders
# Blades & Tomes

Blades & Tomes is a turn-based dungeon crawl game made with the libGDX engine
where you play as an adventurer, wishing to strike his fortune within the deep depths
of dark dungeons. To learn more about the project, please refer to the project
description on the wiki [here.](https://github.com/SCCapstone/RubbleRaiders/wiki/Project-Description)

## Requirements

To be able to run the app, please install the following programs:

* [Latest Version of Java](https://www.java.com/en/)
* [JDK version 12.0.2](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk12-archive-downloads.html)
* [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=Windows)

Please make sure you have a folder dedicated to containing the project as well as a willingness
to get "down and dirty" into Gradle and Java, as well as possibly XML and JSON.

## Setup

To SetUp the local branch, first clone the branch to your workspace directory (let's say "~/my_work_directory").
After this step, then run IntelliJ and select "Open". Move to the "BladeAndTomes" folder and open the
"build.gradle" file. After this step, wait for the program to build the project before doing anything else.
Once the project has built, make sure to click the build icon in IntelliJ to make sure it is built.

## Running

To be able to run the program, please install the latest release of Java, as this utilizes the .jar extension.
A link to install Java is provided below:

https://www.java.com/en/

To install Java, click on the link and follow the instructions provided to get the latest version of Java SE.

For running the program for the first time, click on the "Gradle" side menu, then go to "desktop/other" and
click "Run". This will run the game and automatically update it for IntelliJ, so that each successive time you
run the game, all that needs to be done is click on the "Run" icon and the project will build and attempt to
run.
